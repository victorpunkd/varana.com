#### About the business -

"145 East is a design collective based in Calcutta, India. We're a troupe of passionate visual bandits--outlaws of design who want to bring the local aesthetic of Calcutta to everyday products. From apparel to stationery to household to accessories, we keep churning out new things that are exciting to make. We're storytellers, architects, mathematics majors, graphic designers, illustrators, and we have a labrador who is our marketing head and full time stress buster.

All of our products are handcrafted, organic, and sustainable using a local fabric called gamcha. Our accessories are upcycled using gamcha scraps. We believe in eco-friendly and slow fashion. With this, our work empowers local artisans and weavers of Bengal.

More importantly, we're a fun circus and our work is serious fun."

## How to run the project

1. You need to install node npm globally in your local machine.
2. Then you can pull this repo to your local machine or you can download the code in your local machine.
3. Once done open cmd or terminal and navigate to the project folder.
4. Then run `npm run` it will download all the dependencies mentioned in the package.json file to the current folder.
5. Once the installation is complete run `npm start` to run the project locally.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
